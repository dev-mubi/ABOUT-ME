Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m Mubashir Shahzaib, and I have just started my journey in the world of programming. Right now, I’m diving into C, and I recently published my first academic project in it! I’m excited to learn and grow in this amazing community, and I can’t wait to connect with others who share my passion.

Feel free to reach out through  Instagram link in my profile—I’d love to chat!
